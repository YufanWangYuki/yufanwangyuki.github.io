<h1>Research</h1>
<h2><b>Deep Learning</b></h2>
<h3>2019.03 - 2020.03, <i>Renmin University of China</i>
<p><b>Optic Cup and Disc Segmentation Based on Stereoscopic Fundus Images for Glaucoma Diagnosis</b></p>
</h3>

<i>Independent Researcher</i>
<br><br>
<p>2019.03 - 2019.05
Literature review on the deep learning methods applied in glaucoma diagnosis.</p>
<p>2019.05 - 2019.07
Preprocessed the 6000+ stereoscopic fundus images, applied U-Net to segment optic disc and cup as well as do the job of fine tuning. The IoU is 0.75 which is not satisfied so I decided to use it as my benchmark.</p>
<p>2019.07 - 2019.09
Came up with the idea of using the time-sequence feature of LSTM, so combined LSTM with U-Net.</p>
<p>2019.09 - 2019.09
Several papers researching on the field of stereoscopic images in Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2019 came out, which were pretty inspiring! By comparison, DAVA-Net is more suitable for my project, because the input and output of the model are both pictures, and the sub-network of it can extract the depth information in the stereo picture.</p>
<p>2019.09 - present
Adjust the DAVA-Net structure to make it suitable for optic disc and cup segmentation.</p>

<h2><b>Drone</b></h2>
<h3>2018.06 - 2019.05, <i>Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</i>
<p><b>Drone Performance-Aided Design and Control System</b></p></h3>
<i>Algorithm Designer</i>
<br><br>
<p>Designed and optimized flight algorithms of drone formation using MATLAB to adopt the discrete controller to realize the master-slave flight mode. Eventually, flight formation of four drones can be achieved, and the formation shape were developed from 2-D to 3-D. Generated the simulation interfaces of drone formation by identifying userâ€™s input.</p>

<h2><b>Hardware</b></h2>
<h3>2018.07 - 2018.10, <i>Tsinghua University</i>
<p><b>Acquisition of GPS Information by Using STM32</b></p></h3>
<i>Independent Researcher</i>
<br><br>
<p>Implemented basic experiments on the development board, such as breathing lights, serial DMA data receiving and sending experiments, etc. Used the HAL library to obtain GPS information and utilized STM32L476 to transfer the data to the port.</p>
